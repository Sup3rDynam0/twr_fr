Hey There! 

Today's Worldwide Rock is a Flask web-app that tweets once a day about a rock song chosen from among any country around the globe. A country, genre and song are all chosen at random and presented on a daily basis on Twitter at @twr_rock

This is a personal project built within a Flask-based Python web-app meant to showcase the backend scripts and will allow users to keep track of the daily songs. 

The front-end theme I will used is an open-source product from appseed.us. Please follow the link below to include it in your own projects too!
# [Flask Pixel Lite](https://appseed.us/product/pixel-bootstrap/flask/)

As of now, the backend side is nearly complete and is mostly awaiting live deployment. The front-end Flask webapp is very much a WIP.

I'll update this readme once the bot is up and running. Definitely go give it a follow once it's ready!
